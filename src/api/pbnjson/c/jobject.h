/**
 * Create - creates a JSON value with ownership given to the caller.  This call will usually only ever return NULL if memory allocation failed or a reference to a valid
 *          JSON value (never a reference to a JSON null).  Still, it is recommended to use jis_null to check the result (in fact, always use jis_null instead of actually
 *          comparing against some value).  For instance, the creation of a number from a double might return null if you attempt to provide it with a NaN or an infinity or any other
 *          unsupported value.
 *
 * Copy - grab ownership of the specified value.  Any changes to val must be reflected in the resultant value.
 * Release - release ownership of the specified value (after a Release, it is forbidden to use the pointer)
 * Get - no ownership change - only valid for as long as the parent has an owner for the duration the child is used.
 * Set/Add - no ownership change - both the parent that has a value set and the original owner have valid references (parent will grab a copy)
 * Put/Append - ownership is transferred to the jvalue_ref parent ( you lose ownership - the lifetime of the object becomes that of the parent unless you have explicitely
 *              grabbed a copy before-hand)
 * Remove - ownership is removed from the parent (& the parent will lose all references to the value).
 *
 * NOTE: Any unspecified behaviours listed are not an exhaustive list (and do not necessarily appear as a NOTE but will be attempted to be documented as such).
 * Any usage of the API that isn't explicitly documented, or is marked as simply the current implementation of unspecified behaviour,
 * is considered unspecified and suceptible to breakage at any time.  If a particular unspecified behaviour is necessary, please contact the maintainer to 
 * update the documentation & change the API if appropriate.  Unspecified behaviour may result in crashes or incorrect program behaviour.
 *
 * NOTE: It is unspecified the actual value that a reference to a JSON null value will have (it is possible for it to be different from a C NULL & it is in the current implementation).
 *       The only guarantee is that jis_null will properly tell you if the value is a reference to a JSON null value or not.
 *
 * NOTE: It is unspecified the behaviour of the DOM inspection/modification functions if a NULL pointer
 *       or a JSON null reference is passed as the DOM node.
 *
 * NOTE: Unspecified behaviour results from passing in a C-NULL instead of the result from jnull() in to the API that is expecting a jvalue_ref.  In the current implementation it might be
 *       safe sometimes to do so.
 *
 * NOTE: It is unspecified what happens if the string pointer is null or the length is 0 when a raw_buffer is used
 *       to retrieve parameters from an object.  It is unspecified what happens is jis_null returns true for a jvalue_ref
 *       used as the key to lookup within an object.
 *
 * If a parameter to a function is marked as NON_NULL, then the behaviour is undefined if NULL is passed in
 * (with a release binary, it is likely to crash).  It is the callers responsibility to ensure that NULL is checked for.
